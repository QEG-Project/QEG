Electrical breakdown protection, two choices
________________________
First choice

http://www.nanoprotech.ru/eng/products/super-line/super-insulation-nanoprotech.html

Its called Nanoprotech electric from Russia and it does a hell of a job.Electrical insulation that even works under water.This type of nano structures has the right structure for a long lasting bonding with the copper structure.(Don`t try this with Never wet and commercial products of that kind ,they wont last,they don`t have the right structural adhearance)

Super Insulation NANOPROTECH
Super Insulation NANOPROTECH

Liquid electrical insulation

- Prevents current leakage and short circuit
- Penetrates deeply and displaces 100% of moisture
- Restores electronic devices
- Increases insulation resistance to 1000%
- Stable invisible nanocoating protects for long
- Electric devices can work in water

Purpose: the product is unique in that it replaces 100% of moisture. It restores a working capacity of damaged by moisture electric equipment without dismantling. The product prevents current leakage and insulation breakdown. A stable invisible nanocoating surely protects household and industrial electric devices even in water. The product provides a powerful protection for at least 1 year and increases service life of devices and equipment.

Properties: Super Insulation builds a long-life protection from all kind of moisture. Nanoparticles penetrate in the structure of the applied surface, displace moisture and clean from oxides. It instantly restores an insulation resistance and significantly improves a current conductivity. The product penetrates to hard-to-reach spots and can be applied on wet surfaces. Super Insulation maintains its elasticity for long and is harmless for all materials.

Application areas: electrical equipment car and other vehicles (terminals, connectors, adapters, tremblers, boost coils, generators), garden equipment, high-voltage cables, external lights, sockets, power supply filters, electric panels, electric tools, grass-mowers, saws, screw guns, electronic plates, microcircuits, and the like.
Safety precautions: the can is under pressure. Keep away from direct sunlight and do not heat up to the temperature above + 50ºC.Do not store and spray nearby open fire, scorching objects, or current-carrying devices. Keep away from children. Do not open the can even after the aerosol ran out. Use in well-ventilated places. If the spray got to eyes, wash eyes with water. If the spray got to skin, wash skin with water and soap. The product is inflammable. After use or shelf life expiration, discard as domestic waste. The spray does not destroy an ozone layer.

Recommendations for use: make sure to shake the can before use. Spray 20-30 cm away from the surface. After application on the surface, nanocoating grips during 10 minutes. If necessary, delete an excess of spray. Wait for 24 hours to get the best protection.
Consumption: one can for 2 sq.m. It is recommended to apply at the temperature range from - 20ºC to +35ºC. The product does not lose its properties at large temperature range from - 80ºC to +140ºC.

Duration of action: more than 1 year after application provided the storage and usage conditions are observed

Composition: highly refined mineral oil, anticorrosion additives, antioxidants, dearomatized paraffin and naphthene hydrocarbons, NANOPROTECH formula, hydrocarbon propellant. The product was developed by using hi-tech.
